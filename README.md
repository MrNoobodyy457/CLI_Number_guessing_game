# CLI_Number_guessing_game
A simple CLI number guessing game in Python with hints, guess tracking, and replay option. One of my first beginner projects.

# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (CLI)

A simple number guessing game built using Python.

The program randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. It gives hints along the way, tells you if you're getting close, and prevents repeated guesses.

## 📚 Features

- Random number generation
- Hint system based on how close you are
- Prevents duplicate guesses
- Tracks how many attempts you took
- Option to play again or quit

## 🧠 What I Learned

This was one of my first few Python projects. I learned to use:

- The `random` module
- Lists to store data
- Friendly user interaction in the terminal

## 🚧 Future Plans

Here are a few ideas I plan to explore as I learn more:

- [ ] 🎮 **Difficulty levels** (easy, medium, hard)  
      – For harder modes, hints might be removed and attempts might be limited 
- [ ] 📉 **Limit number of attempts**  
      – Add a "Game Over" message if the guess count is too high  
- [ ] 🎨 **Improve UX messages** (make them funnier/more interactive)  
- [ ] 🔁 **Replay with new range**  
      – Ask user to choose custom min and max values  
- [ ] 🪟 **GUI version**
      – Make it visual instead of terminal-based

A fun little CLI project while learning Python step by step.
